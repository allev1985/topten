# Specification Quality Checklist: Login Modal Panel Component

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-05  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation completed successfully on 2025-12-05**

All checklist items have been validated and pass. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Changes made during validation:**
- Removed technical terminology (server action, ARIA, WCAG standards) from user-facing scenarios
- Replaced implementation-specific success criteria (test coverage, technical standards) with user-focused outcomes
- Added Dependencies and Assumptions section to document context and constraints
- Generalized file path references to focus on functionality rather than implementation details
